# The Cosmic Energy Cycles Search

When I was 14 years old visited the home of my parent's neighbour (her name is Esperanza), immediately my eyes couldn't stop to look around all mystical objects she had everywhere, from all those magical things, she took a metal bowl (indian) and start to move a wooden stick around it, a beautiful harmonious sound was produced, I was astonished. She explained that everything in the cosmos was vibrating, including our physical body, that all those vibrations are combining and interacting all the time, that all of us has a vibrational blueprint that is impregnated at our birth, we could find our energy purpose by looking at the position of the planets at the moment of our first breathing (the birth and origin). I was curious to know what stars could say about my life so very gently, she invited me to enter a room where she had a computer with an astrological software "Solar Fire" and dedicated some time to calculate my astrological natal chart and do a quick interpretation. I feel the match, whatever was contained in that wheel filled wih symbols I couldn't understand described very accurately my essential forces, my personality, interests, desires, familiar relationships and much more. From that moment an immense need of knowledge burned in me, my search to try to understand the manifestation of the cosmic energy started.

# The Knowledge Sources Discovery

My family don't believed in astrology, my mom and dad call it a superstitious or pseudo-science used by charlatans, as you imagine at my parents house you wouldn't expect to find an astrology book, right? Not sure why and who bring it to home but there was only one, very basic, just explained the planets and zodiacal signs but was enough for me to start. I was firm in my belief that astrology should have a solid foundations, that some deep knowledge was waiting for me to be discovered.

# Donceles Street Mexico City

I don't remember who advised me to visit the second-hand book stores at the Donceles Street, Mexico City, that person suggested that in this place I can find books for any ancient knowledge, including aztec and maya civilizations. I was 16 years old and ready to dedicate hundreds of hours reviewing at every bookshelf in order to discover all the secrets that astrology was holding for me. Literally, I went store by store from the beginning to the end, reviewed every space across all Donceles street. Every weekend I found one or two books relevant for my research but one day the miracle occurred, at "Libreria Nely", Donceles #105, the saleswoman, tired of taking back and forth a bunch of astrology books from the warehouse, invited me to get in into some dark antique rooms, she told me: nobody can access here, however, you are so curious and good client so will help in your search, in all those bookshelves there are thousands of books about esoteric topics, including astrology, take your time and review whatever you like, feel at home. I was very excited, was impressed, in some hours I found that there was batch of books, presumably from the same family that decided to sell all their astrology catalog to this book store, there was around two hundred, unfortunately I don't have enough money to purchase all the catalog at once so needed to go step by step. During 3 years, every weekend I visited this store and purchased one or two books. I got around 60 from this collection which is my most precious treasure that is kept at my parents home at Mexico City.

# Family & Friends Astro Charts Interpretation

I acquired many books to contrast different authors knowledge, access to different interpretation methods and prognostic approaches: primary and secondary progressions, solar and lunar return, solar arc, transits, primary directions and 
symbolic directions. Therefore, I was able to research those techniques in order to find what works well and  understand the cosmic purpose of my family members (parents, sisters, cousins and so forth) energy. The problem was that doing all this studies manually was time-consuming (difficult to interpret) and hard to validate, people don't tend to register all the daily events so comparing the dates of astro events with life events to confirm the correlations was impossible, the volunteers for the study don't collaborated enough, one day I concluded that cannot continue move on through this study, that the only possibility was to stick the research to my own natal chart. However, was concerned that judging myself could suffer from personal bias, frustrated of those blockers, abandoned the research.

# Learning Software Development

My other passion was sit in front of computer during prolonged sessions, learning how to instruct a machine to do computations for me and presenting content at web pages, I started developing basic pages with Geocities. One day tried to figured out how to do massive calculation of all my natal chart progression and directions for entire lifetime so took a look at some planets orbits calculation but noted that was very complex, at that moment I was not able to achieve my goal but learned how to create web pages and started an esoteric online community in the times of IRC chat, I spent many nights discussing tarot, astral projection, astrology, dowsing among other great topics and met wise people. Some years later, when got married and moved to Madrid, Spain this talent for computers became my main profession, passion and way of living. With some patience some years later I found the Swiss Ephemeris and astrological open source software that studied in detail to figure out how to do the massive computations that I needed.
